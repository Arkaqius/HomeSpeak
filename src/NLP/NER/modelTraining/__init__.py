# About module
__name__ = "VoiceHAC NER module - Training Mode submodule"
__doc__ = """
The Training Mode submodule is part of the VoiceHAC NER (Named Entity Recognition) module. 
It is responsible for training the NER model based on the supplied training data. 
The trained model is then used by the NER module for entity recognition and classification.

This submodule performs the following tasks:

- Data Preparation: It prepares the raw training data into a format suitable for model training.
- Model Training: It uses the prepared data to train the NER model. It adjusts the model's parameters
  based on the training data to optimize its performance.

Main features:
1) Model training: This submodule can train a NER model using the provided training data.

Please note, this submodule is an integral part of the VoiceHAC NER module and is designed 
to work in conjunction with it. It doesn't function as a standalone unit.
